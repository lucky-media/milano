## Configuration

Milano is created to be ready-to-use out of the box. Access the control panel to begin customizing your e-commerce site. We ensure Milano will remain up-to-date with future Statamic releases.

### Content

Milano comes pre-configured with essential e-commerce pages and components, allowing you to focus on adding your products and content. Use our sets to highlight featured products, answer customer FAQs, and introduce your team.

If you need to support another language it's as easy as changing your locale on config `app.locale` and then translating the content of `lang/en.json` to the desired language.
